# ATM-Improvements
Updating ATM setup to allow user to deposit or withdrawal money

Latest updates: updated user interface to be more visual (ie colors), added functionality to prevent users from withdrawaling more money than they have, if they do put in a withdrawal than more than they have an alert also pops up telling them the total balance and greatest amount they can withdrawal. Also, the buttons were removed so now a user has to select from the drop down what they would like to do before an input field is visible.
